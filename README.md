## Project overview

This project consists of building a **web server from scratch** with **Docker** to host a real-time, Pong-based web application.  
Users can **sign in securely**, manage their profile, view **match history and stats**, add **friends**, and play matches in real time.

### Tech stack
- **Backend:** Django (+ Django Channels for WebSockets), PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript  
- **Infra:** Docker / Docker Compose

### My role
I **implemented the entire backend in Django**:
- Designed the data model (users, matches, stats, friendships) in **Django ORM** with **PostgreSQL**.
- Built the REST endpoints and server-side logic for authentication, profile data, match history and statistics.
- Added **real-time** communication using **Django Channels** (WebSockets) to connect the JS frontend with the Python backend.
- Integrated everything in **Docker Compose** for local development and deployment.

I also created a simple **3D version** of the game using **three.js**.

### (Experiment) AI opponent
I experimented with an AI that could play Pong using **PyTorch**, training with **OpenAI Gym**.  
The idea was to save model weights at different training stages to provide multiple difficulty levels.  
We chose not to ship the AI as it wasnâ€™t reliable enough yet, but it was a great first dive into building and training a small neural network.
